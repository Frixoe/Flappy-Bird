# Flappy-Bird
A clone of the famous game Flappy Bird.

## Information
My goal with this was to repicate the original Flappy Bird. The physics of the bird are the same as in the game.

## Dissimilarities
**In the original game...**
+ There are always *3 pairs of pipes on the screen.* However, in this game, there is only *1 pair*. As soon as the pair reaches the *end of the screen*, it's coordinates are reset and it starts back with *different y and x coordinates.*
+ The bird is animated. In this game, however, the bird isn't.

## Improvement
Improvements can be made. However, I would like someone else to add them :) I will definitely merge your addition if it's good.
